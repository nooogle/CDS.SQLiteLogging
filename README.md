# CDS.SQLiteLogging

NOTE: this branch (custom_logging) contains the final code that provided for 
a custom log type, along with reflection and othe code needed to create 
custom tables. This was written before I learnt much about the Microsoft
logging framework, and I think using the MS framework with scopes, categories 
and structured logging provides most of the features I wanted from the custom
approach. Using the MS version provides for a more standard approach and
compatibility with other logging tools.
